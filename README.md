Link - https://odrinl.github.io/team-project-quiz-app/

Client-side web application.

## The requirements

- The project needs to be a quiz
- The quiz needs to require the user to answer 10 questions
- Every question in the quiz needs to have 4 answers
- There needs to be a button to go to the next question
- The project needs to be deployed somewhere

## Backlog

- A user can see one question at a time, stepping through the quiz
- A user can select an answer for each question
- Change the <title>
- add a favicon
- A user can see what the correct answer is after they selected their answer.
- A user can see their score update in real-time as they select answers
- A user can refresh the page and still have his/her given answers available
- A user can "skip" the question and learn the correct answer, this forfeits the question
- Transition between pages or question look fancy like TypeForm for example
